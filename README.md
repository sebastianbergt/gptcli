# Usage

```shell
$ ./gptcli.py "What is the best lense setting for a portrait photo?"
As an AI language model, I do not have personal preferences or opinions. However, generally, a portrait photo is best captured using a lens with a focal length of 50-85mm as it allows for a flattering level of compression and reduces distortion. A wider aperture of f/2.8 to f/5.6 can help create a shallow depth of field, isolating the subject from the background and creating a pleasing bokeh effect. The exact settings may vary depending on the lighting conditions, the subject's location, and the photographer's creative vision.
